; the BBC micro used a 256-px wide screen mode, but the C64 has a 320-px wide
; screen. therefore the C64 only draws in a 256-px wide centered 'screen'.
; the dimensions of this viewport are given here:

; (DON'T change this, the code is inextricably tied to this size)

ELITE_VIEWPORT_WIDTH    = 256
ELITE_VIEWPORT_HEIGHT   = 144

ELITE_VIEWPORT_COLS     = ELITE_VIEWPORT_WIDTH / 8      ;=32

; the HUD occupies 7 lines at the bottom of the screen; this fact is used in
; a wide variety of calculations and implicit values in non-obvious ways

ELITE_HUD_HEIGHT_ROWS   = 7
ELITE_HUD_TOP_ROW       = 25 - ELITE_HUD_HEIGHT_ROWS

;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

; the VIC-II uses a 1 KB block of RAM for the text-screen (40x25 = 1'000 bytes)
; or, in the case of high-resolution bitmap mode, colour-cell information where
; each byte represents the fore/back colour (two nybbles) for each 8x8 cell
;
; elite uses two game screens: a main-screen (flight) and a menu-screen (such
; as when docked). the flight-screen switches from high-resolution bitmap mode
; to multi-colour bitmap mode for the HUD at the bottom of the screen -- it's
; important to note that the way high-resolution and multi-colour bitmap modes
; store colour is _very_ different
;
; the location in memory of the text-screen / colour-data, character-set and
; bitmap are determined by a single register, $D018, consisting of two fields:
;
; bits 4-7 select the location of the text-screen / colour-data, which can be
; any of these values: (note that these addresses are relative to the VIC-II
; bank address above)
; 
;  0 = +$0000   /    8 = +$2000
;  1 = +$0400   /    9 = +$2400
;  2 = +$0800   /   10 = +$2800
;  3 = +$0C00   /   11 = +$2C00
;  4 = +$1000   /   12 = +$3000
;  5 = +$1400   /   13 = +$3400
;  6 = +$1800   /   14 = +$3800
